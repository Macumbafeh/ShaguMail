# ShaguMail

A TBC Addon/Library that tries to push opening mailboxes to the limit. It doesn't have any waits inside and fetches as fast as the server allows to. This might lead to server messages like internal mail errors. Use at your own risk. However, I haven't lost any item so far. The addon focused on simplicity and is using as less code as possible. It might not work on your server, feel free to open an issue in case of trouble.

A vanilla version will follow someday.
